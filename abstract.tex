People that suffer from mood disorders primarily seek assistance through conventional means, and are provided tools to help them.
However these tools are physical, and there is a general lack of technological tools for assisting people with mental illnesses in general.

We research mood disorders and related topics along with mobile development topics for the purpose of providing a mobile platform that can help people that suffer from them and provide a toolset that can assist them with their condition.

Based on that research, a platform called PsyLog is implemented and presented.
PsyLog is a platform that is easily extensible with external modules that can provide new functionality.
PsyLog is a first effort and requires further development and research before it is mature enough to be put into actual use.

Two separate projects that use PsyLog as a foundation, were researched and implemented concurrently to the development of PsyLog itself.
